    "Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to create an AI-powered research paper chatbot that helps users extract, summarize, and understand content from academic papers. It will offer an interactive Q&A experience, providing accurate, contextually relevant answers to questions about specific sections, making complex research information more accessible and comprehensible.\n",
